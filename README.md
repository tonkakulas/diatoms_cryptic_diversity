# DIATOMS CRYPTIC DIVERSITY

This repository contains tutorials on data analysis and graphical presentation of diatom metabarcoding data, aimed at assessing global genetic diversity of diatoms in rivers and examining its structure across a wide geographic area spanning four climate zones (Nordic, Temperate, Equatorial, and Mediterranean) across Europe, Africa, and Central and South America. Bioinformatics analyses of the raw data (forward and reverse reads) from various sequencing runs were conducted on the INRAE-Migale Bioinformatics Facility, while all data analysis and graphical visualizations were performed using R (version 4.3.2).
The data was produced as part of the article by Kula≈° et al.
